            <h2>General Information</h2>
            <p>
              The following Terms of Service (the "Agreement") are important and require careful reading. Your
              acceptance of these "Terms of Service" signifies your agreement to be bound by them. This Agreement is between you and
              <strong>DuckovGame</strong> (hereinafter: "Site", "us", "we", or "our") and pertains to your use
              of our website, including any materials and services available therein, and any successor site(s) thereto (the
              "Site").
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>BY USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE OLDER THAN 16
                  YEARS.</strong> Any reference to "you" or "your" in this Agreement applies to the individual who
              uses the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Agreement includes a mandatory arbitration provision, explained in Section 11 below. This provision
              requires arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials, court
              proceedings, or class actions. Please review this section carefully.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>
              This Agreement may be amended periodically, and we will notify you of such changes through reasonable
              means, which may include posting a revised Agreement on the Site. Any changes made will not apply to disputes
              that arose prior to the date of such changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              By using the Site after changes are posted, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. Continued use
              will be deemed acceptance of the changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to modify or discontinue all or part of the Site, adjust or waive fees, or offer
              special opportunities to some or all Site users at any time, without liability.

            <p>
              This Agreement does not create any partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency relationship
              between you and <strong>DuckovGame</strong>. If any provision is unenforceable, it will be removed without

              You may not transfer your rights or obligations without our consent, but we may assign ours without
