        <p>This comprehensive guide covers all essential game mechanics in <a href="/">Escape from Duckov</a>, from base management and character development to combat systems and exploration strategies. Master these core systems to maximize your survival potential.</p>
        
        <h2>I. Base Management and Crafting Systems</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Base Functions and Configuration</h3>
        
        <h4>Difficulty Management</h4>
        <p><strong>Dynamic Difficulty:</strong> Game difficulty settings (including Survival mode) can be modified at any time using the desk in your base (press F key). This allows you to adjust challenge level based on your current equipment and experience.</p>
        
        <h4>Blueprint Research System</h4>
        <p><strong>Registration Process:</strong> After locating the blueprint research station in your base, you must register all scavenged blueprints (such as Cube Gun recipes) to unlock crafting options and free up valuable inventory space.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic Benefits:</strong> Registered blueprints prevent duplicate collection and provide permanent access to crafting recipes without carrying physical blueprints.</p>
        
        <h4>Building Upgrades</h4>
        <p><strong>Progressive Enhancement:</strong> Facilities like workbenches, tech centers, and gyms can be upgraded to unlock advanced crafting capabilities and specialized functions.</p>
        <p><strong>Advanced Processing:</strong> Upgrading your workbench to Advanced Processing unlocks weapon repair functions, essential for maintaining equipment durability.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Storage and Inventory Management</h3>
        
        <h4>Stash System</h4>
        <p><strong>Safe Storage:</strong> Your base stash serves as the secure storage area for all items. Use "Store All" to quickly transfer items from your inventory to storage.</p>
        <p><strong>Space Expansion:</strong> Stash capacity can be increased by investing currency and materials in storage upgrades.</p>
        
        <h4>Item Protection</h4>
        <p><strong>Slot Locking:</strong> Press the L key to lock specific item slots. Locked items are protected from accidental transfer via "Store All" or selling functions.</p>
        <p><strong>Equipment Safety:</strong> This system prevents loss of valuable equipment during inventory management operations.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Crafting and Resource Tracking</h3>
        
        <h4>Item Marking System</h4>
        <p><strong>Material Tracking:</strong> In crafting and upgrade interfaces, press N on required materials to add heart icons next to them. This visual system helps track quest items and crafting requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Quest Integration:</strong> Marked items are easily identifiable during looting, streamlining quest completion and resource gathering.</p>
        
        <h4>Dismantling Mechanics</h4>
        <p><strong>Resource Conversion:</strong> Many items (including Rusty Bullets and plastic components) can be dismantled into basic materials like Gunpowder for crafting or quest submission.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency Strategy:</strong> Regular dismantling maximizes resource utilization and provides materials for advanced crafting projects.</p>
        
        <h2>II. Character Development and Progression</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Attribute Enhancement and Perks</h3>
        
        <h4>Perk Palace System</h4>
        <p><strong>Core Progression:</strong> The Perk Palace serves as the primary character advancement system, offering permanent buffs through Cash and Core Fragment investment.</p>
        <p><strong>Priority Recommendation:</strong> Backpack Expert provides additional weight capacity and storage space - the most valuable early-game investment for expedition efficiency.</p>
        
        <h4>Physical Training</h4>
        <p><strong>Mud's Training:</strong> Visit Mud in the gym to access physical training programs that permanently increase attributes like maximum health.</p>
        <p><strong>Long-term Benefits:</strong> Physical training provides permanent stat improvements, making it a worthwhile investment for character development.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Survival and Medical Systems</h3>
        
        <h4>Healing Item Categories</h4>
        <p><strong>Health Restoration:</strong> Bandages and First Aid Kits restore health points and are essential for combat survival.</p>
        <p><strong>Pain Management:</strong> Aspirin relieves pain but causes dehydration - monitor water intake after usage.</p>
        <p><strong>Bleeding Control:</strong> Herat serves as hemostatic medicine, specifically designed to treat bleeding status effects.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Movement and Combat Mechanics</h3>
        
        <h4>Speed Optimization</h4>
        <p><strong>Weapon Holstering:</strong> Press C to holster your weapon, increasing movement speed - particularly effective when carrying rifles or heavy weapons.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic Mobility:</strong> Holstering weapons is crucial for quick repositioning and escape scenarios.</p>
        
        <h4>Evasion Techniques</h4>
        <p><strong>Dodge Rolling:</strong> Use the spacebar for dodge rolls when fighting melee enemies. This is essential for avoiding fatal attacks from Rampaging Scavengers.</p>
        <p><strong>Timing Critical:</strong> Master the timing of dodge rolls to maximize survival against high-damage melee opponents.</p>
        
        <h2>III. Combat Systems and Equipment</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Firearm Mechanics and Damage</h3>
        
        <h4>Ammunition Types</h4>
        <p><strong>Caliber Variety:</strong> Different firearms use specific ammunition types (S, L, AR rounds). Early weapons like Glick use S rounds, while AK-74U requires AR rounds. Browse our <a href="/items/ammunition">ammunition database</a> and <a href="/items/weapons">weapons database</a> for complete compatibility information.</p>
        <p><strong>Rusty Bullets:</strong> Common early ammunition with reduced damage output - requires more shots to eliminate enemies effectively.</p>
        
        <h4>Range and Accuracy</h4>
        <p><strong>Distance Indicator:</strong> The UI displays a range indicator in the lower right corner, showing optimal weapon effectiveness.</p>
        <p><strong>Color Coding:</strong> Green/White indicates effective range with maximum damage, while Red signals reduced damage due to range or accuracy issues.</p>
        <p><strong>Attachment Effects:</strong> Weapon modifications like suppressors and muzzle brakes directly impact range effectiveness and damage output.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Enemy Behavior and Tactics</h3>
        
        <h4>Rampaging Scavengers</h4>
        <p><strong>Melee Threats:</strong> High-damage melee enemies with clear attack patterns. Red flash warnings precede weapon swings - your signal to dodge roll.</p>
        <p><strong>Combat Strategy:</strong> Maintain distance and use dodge rolls to avoid their devastating melee attacks.</p>
        
        <h4>Environmental Advantages</h4>
        <p><strong>Cover Utilization:</strong> Sandbags provide excellent cover. Enemies, especially ranged attackers, have difficulty hitting targets behind sandbag barriers.</p>
        <p><strong>Positioning Strategy:</strong> Use terrain features to minimize enemy accuracy and maximize your combat effectiveness.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Equipment and Protection</h3>
        
        <h4>Armor Systems</h4>
        <p><strong>Damage Reduction:</strong> Armor and helmets provide direct damage mitigation. Advanced equipment like SWAT Helmets significantly improve early-game survivability. Check our <a href="/items/equipment">equipment database</a> to compare protection levels and stats.</p>
        <p><strong>Durability Management:</strong> All equipment has durability ratings. Damaged items can be repaired at repair workbenches using currency.</p>
        
        <h2>IV. Exploration and Economic Systems</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Extraction Mechanics</h3>
        
        <h4>Ground Zero Specificity</h4>
        <p><strong>Unique Extraction:</strong> Ground Zero doesn't require reaching designated extraction points. Simply return to the base entrance for safe extraction.</p>
        <p><strong>Other Maps:</strong> Most locations require finding extraction points marked with green smoke or locating special exit points.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Specialized Storage Solutions</h3>
        
        <h4>Pet Slot Functionality</h4>
        <p><strong>Heavy Item Storage:</strong> Located above your backpack, the Pet Slot is designed for heavy or extremely valuable items you cannot afford to lose.</p>
        <p><strong>Weight Exemption:</strong> Items in the Pet Slot don't contribute to your total weight, making it ideal for Car Batteries, large cash amounts, and critical quest items.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Trading and Commerce</h3>
        
        <h4>Mysterious Merchant</h4>
        <p><strong>Fixed Location Trading:</strong> Located at a specific Ground Zero position, this merchant accepts Cash for rare quest items including Honey, Pens, and IV Medicine.</p>
        <p><strong>Preparation Requirement:</strong> You must bring Cash into the map before entering to trade with the Mysterious Merchant.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Map Expansion and Shortcuts</h3>
        
        <h4>Sewer Access</h4>
        <p><strong>Secondary Route:</strong> Unlocked by removing obstacles on specific roads after bridge repairs, providing alternative Ground Zero access points.</p>
        
        <h4>Teleportation System</h4>
        <p><strong>Unlock Method:</strong> Use Dynamite to detonate the cracked wall outside your base entrance.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic Value:</strong> Creates a two-way teleportation shortcut, enabling instant travel between map endpoints - the most crucial early-game unlock for efficient corpse recovery and expedition management.</p>
        
        <h2>V. Risk Management and Death Systems</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Death Penalties and Recovery</h3>
        
        <h4>Item Loss Mechanics</h4>
        <p><strong>Complete Loss:</strong> Death results in loss of all carried items, making risk assessment crucial for expedition planning.</p>
        <p><strong>Corpse Recovery:</strong> Your items remain in a corpse bag at your death location, requiring re-entry to recover them.</p>
        
        <h4>Second Death Risk</h4>
        <p><strong>Permanent Loss:</strong> Dying again before recovering your corpse bag results in permanent loss of all previous items.</p>
        <p><strong>Recovery Strategy:</strong> Travel light and use the fastest route when recovering corpse bags to minimize risk.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Risk Mitigation Strategies</h3>
        
        <h4>Teleportation Advantage</h4>
        <p><strong>Quick Recovery:</strong> The Teleport Bubble (Dynamite shortcut) is essential for rapid corpse recovery and risk reduction.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Plan expeditions with corpse recovery routes in mind, prioritizing safety over speed.</p>

      <h3>Resource Farming and Extermination</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Focus your run on areas rich in electronic components and toolboxes to quickly find the required **Screws** and **Graphics Card**.</li>

      <h3>Skill Maxing: Achieving Peak Performance</h3>
      <p>This is the opportunity to **max out** these critical skills, significantly impacting your future performance:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>**Energy Reserve III:** Increases maximum energy by **+10**. (Provides maximum sprinting/dodging capability).</li>
          <li>**Nutrient Intake III:** Increases the effect of food and water by **+10%**. (Maximizes passive healing and resource efficiency).</li>
          <li>**Steady Shot III:** Increases hip-fire accuracy by **+10%**. (Makes close-quarters combat extremely reliable).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ground Zero: The Final Farm Run</h2>
      <p>Your objective remains the same: complete the extermination and resource quotas, and defeat the **Duckmother** one last time to ensure maximum resources and access the AS VAL for its components or ammo.</p>

      <h3>Run Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Quickly secure the required **Screws** and **Graphics Card** and complete the **Mosquito Elimination III** and **Punisher III** quotas.</li>
          <li>Confirm the location of the **Abandoned Camp** and prepare for the boss encounter.</li>
          <li>(Optional: If you still need the weapon, search for the **VSS** again).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Final Duckmother Encounter</h3>
      <p>With your fully maxed Tier III skills, the **Duckmother** should be easier to handle. Engage her using your maximum **Energy Reserve** for sustained kiting and utilize **Steady Shot III** for devastating close-range hip-fire.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Defeat the **Duckmother** and retrieve the **Key to the Locked Room**.</li>
          <li>Access the Locked Room to collect the **AS VAL** (or its high-value ammo/components).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Post-Run Activities: Preparing for the Next Map</h2>

      <img src="/images/guide/guide17-02.webp" alt="Escape from Duckov walkthrough part 6" class="guide-image" />

        <p>This comprehensive guide covers the complete process of accessing Duckov's most dangerous area - the Storm Zone. Learn how to activate power systems, acquire necessary certificates, defeat the Roadblock boss, and prepare for extreme endgame challenges. For <a href="/maps">map locations</a> and detailed area information, visit our maps section.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Facility Power Activation</h2>
        
        <h3>Ground Floor Power Switch</h3>
        <p><strong>Initial Activation:</strong> Navigate to the ground floor and locate the first power breaker. This is your starting point for the entire power activation sequence.</p>
        <p><strong>Rogue Patrols:</strong> Stay extremely alert - heavily armed Rogues patrol this area with high-damage weapons and armor-piercing ammunition. These enemies can eliminate unprepared players quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>Combat Preparation:</strong> Ensure you have adequate ammunition and medical supplies before engaging. Rogues are significantly more dangerous than standard enemies.</p>
        
        <h3>Basement Power Switch</h3>
        <p><strong>Hazardous Descent:</strong> After activating the first breaker, proceed to the basement to activate the second power switch. This area contains environmental hazards that require careful navigation.</p>
        <p><strong>Yellow Stim Usage:</strong> Use a Yellow Stim to enhance your movement speed and dash through dangerous sections safely. This temporary buff is essential for surviving the hazardous basement area.</p>
        <p><strong>Quick Exit Strategy:</strong> Once power is activated, avoid lingering in the basement. The activated power systems may trigger additional hazards or enemy spawns.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Tier 2 Certificate Acquisition</h2>
        
        <h3>Certificate Spawn Locations</h3>
        <p><strong>Primary Location:</strong> The Tier 2 certificate can spawn inside the Projection Room - check all containers and surfaces thoroughly.</p>
        <p><strong>Secondary Location:</strong> Alternative spawn point is located directly outside the Projection Room door. Search the immediate area if not found inside.</p>
        <p><strong>Search Strategy:</strong> Methodically check both locations as the certificate is essential for progression to higher-tier content.</p>
        
        <h3>Stealth Monster Threats</h3>
        <p><strong>Invisible Predators:</strong> Stealth monsters patrol the Projection Room area and possess the ability to instantly eliminate players wearing Tier 4 armor.</p>
        <p><strong>One-Shot Capability:</strong> These enemies can kill even heavily armored players with a single attack, making them extremely dangerous.</p>
        <p><strong>Clearance Strategy:</strong> Eliminate all nearby Rogues before attempting to loot the certificate. This ensures safer access to the spawn locations.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Roadblock Boss Encounter</h2>
        
        <h3>Boss Preparation</h3>
        <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ensure both power breakers have been activated before attempting the Roadblock encounter. The boss will only spawn with full power activation.</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Return to the first floor after completing power activation to challenge the Roadblock boss.</p>
        <p><strong>Equipment Check:</strong> Verify you have sufficient ammunition, medical supplies, and appropriate armor before engaging.</p>
        
        <h3>Boss Mechanics and Strategy</h3>
        <p><strong>Guaranteed Reward:</strong> Roadblock always drops the Tier 3 certificate upon defeat - this is your guaranteed reward for completing the encounter.</p>
        <p><strong>Combat Approach:</strong> Use cover effectively and maintain distance. Roadblock's attacks are devastating at close range.</p>
        <p><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Conserve ammunition and medical supplies throughout the fight. The encounter can be lengthy and resource-intensive.</p>
        
        <h3>Post-Boss Extraction</h3>
        <p><strong>Certificate Collection:</strong> Immediately collect the Tier 3 certificate from Roadblock's corpse.</p>
        <p><strong>Extraction Route:</strong> Move quickly to the designated extraction zone after defeating the boss. Delaying extraction increases the risk of additional enemy encounters.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Storm Zone Entry</h2>
        
        <h3>Gateway Access</h3>
        <p><strong>Certificate Requirement:</strong> With the Tier 3 certificate in your possession, return to Sector 0 to locate the Storm Zone gateway.</p>
        <p><strong>Entry Process:</strong> Present the certificate at the gateway to gain access to Duckov's most dangerous area.</p>
        <p><strong>Point of No Return:</strong> Once inside the Storm Zone, extraction becomes significantly more challenging.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Storm Zone Preparation and Risks</h2>
        
        <h3>Extreme Danger Assessment</h3>
        <p><strong>Enemy Equipment:</strong> Expect enemies equipped with Tier 6 gear - the highest tier equipment in the game.</p>
        <p><strong>Combat Difficulty:</strong> All enemies inside the Storm Zone are significantly more powerful than those encountered in other areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Survival Challenge:</strong> The Storm Zone represents the ultimate test of player skill, equipment, and preparation.</p>
        
        <h3>Essential Preparation Items</h3>
        <p><strong>Storm Stim Requirement:</strong> Bring at least five Storm Stims before entering. These specialized consumables are essential for countering Storm Zone hazards.</p>
        <p><strong>Equipment Standards:</strong> Ensure your loadout includes the best available <a href="/items/weapons">weapons</a>, <a href="/items/equipment">armor</a>, and consumables. Browse our <a href="/items">items database</a> to find the optimal gear for endgame content.</p>
        <p><strong>Extended Combat Readiness:</strong> Prepare for prolonged engagements with top-tier enemies. Standard equipment may prove insufficient.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Key Terminology and Items</h2>
        
        <h3>Certificate System</h3>
        <p><strong>Tier 2 Certificate:</strong> Required for accessing mid-tier content and progressing toward higher difficulty areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Tier 3 Certificate:</strong> Mandatory key item for Storm Zone access, guaranteed drop from Roadblock boss encounter.</p>
        
        <h3>Enemy Classifications</h3>
        <p><strong>Rogues:</strong> AI opponents with high-end weapons and armor-piercing ammunition, significantly more dangerous than standard enemies.</p>
        <p><strong>Stealth Monsters:</strong> Deadly invisible enemies capable of instant kills, found around the Projection Room area.</p>
        
        <h3>Consumable Items</h3>
        <p><strong>Yellow Stim:</strong> Temporary movement buff ideal for navigating hazardous areas, particularly useful in basement sections.</p>
        <p><strong>Storm Stim:</strong> Specialized consumable designed to counter Storm Zone environmental hazards and combat mechanics.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Strategic Recommendations</h2>
        
        <h3>Preparation Checklist</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Best available weapons and armor</li>
            <li><strong>Consumables:</strong> Medical supplies, Yellow Stims, and Storm Stims</li>

            <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Understanding of enemy patterns and area layouts</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Backup Plans:</strong> Always have extraction routes planned and emergency supplies ready.</p>
        <p><strong>Team Coordination:</strong> If playing with others, coordinate roles and responsibilities for maximum efficiency.</p>

    <p><em>An Efficient Guide to Finding and Using the LEDX</em></p>
    <p>Finding the **LEDX Skin Transilluminator** in *Escape from Duckov* is a key objective for upgrading your hideout and progressing through the game. This rare item is not just valuable for its market price but is essential for crucial quests and hideout upgrades. Knowing where to look and what to save it for can make your search much more efficient.</p>

    <h2>**What is a LEDX? - An Overview**</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**Purpose:** Used to make blood vessels visible for easy injection.</li>
        <li>**Weight:** 0.2kg</li>
        <li>**Item Type:** Medic</li>
        <li>**Item Number:** "#331"</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="/images/guide/guide06-01.webp" alt="LEDX-1"></p>

    <h2>**Core Uses: Why is the LEDX So Important?**</h2>
    <p>Before you consider selling this high-value item, understand its two critical uses in the game. A **found-in-raid** LEDX is a major milestone in your progression.</p>

    <h3>**1. Therapist Quest: "Private Clinic"**</h3>
    <p>At level 35, the Therapist will offer this quest, requiring you to turn in a **found-in-raid LEDX** alongside an ophthalmoscope. The reward is a highly valuable **Item Case**, which provides a massive amount of storage space and is a game-changer for managing your stash.</p>

    <h3>**2. Hideout Upgrade: Medstation Level 3**</h3>
    <p>Upgrading your hideout’s Medstation to its maximum level (Level 3) requires **one LEDX**. This upgrade is essential, as it boosts your overall **healing effectiveness** and unlocks more crafting recipes for advanced medical items.</p>

    <h2>**Where to Find LEDX - Top Locations**</h2>
    <p>While a LEDX can theoretically spawn in many high-tier medical loot locations, some spots are far more reliable than others. Focus your efforts on these areas to maximize your chances.</p>

            <tr>
                <th>Location</th>

        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>**Farmtown Pharmacies**</td>
                <td>Shelves, tables, medical bags</td>
                <td>Considered one of the most reliable and consistent LEDX spawns.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>**USEC Camp (Woods)**</td>
                <td>Stretchers, bodies, medical bags</td>
                <td>A very high LEDX spawn rate, making it a prime farming spot.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>**Lab Areas**</td>
                <td>Medical carts, shelves, metal tins</td>
                <td>High risk, high reward. Requires keys and careful navigation.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>**How to Acquire LEDX Efficiently**</h3>
    <p>
        **Place 1: Head to Farmtown Pharmacies**
        <br>Enter the commercial district and locate the two pharmacies. Systematically check every shelf, table, and loose medical bag for the LEDX.
    </p>
    <p>
        **Place 2: Visit the USEC Camp on the Woods Map**
        <br>Go to the USEC camp area and search the stretchers, bodies, and medical containers. This is a hotspot for all types of valuable medical loot.
    </p>
    <p>
        **Place 3: Explore Lab Areas**
        <br>This is a high-risk option. Use keys to unlock doors to medical rooms (e.g., in the Sanatorium) and check medical carts, shelves, and metal tins. The loot density is high, but so is the danger.
    </p>
    <p><img src="/images/guide/guide06-02.webp" alt="LEDX2" width="50%" style="width: 50%;"></p>

    <h2>**Value and Trading Recommendations**</h2>
    <p>A LEDX sells for a very high price on the Flea Market (often **16,250 HKD** or more), making it tempting to sell immediately. However, this is usually a mistake.</p>
    
    <p>**Strong Recommendation: Do NOT rush to sell it!**</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Save at least two:** You will need one for the Medstation upgrade and another for the "Private Clinic" quest. Make sure you have these covered before selling any extras.</li>
        <li>**Player experience confirms this:** As players often advise, "You will need 3 for later tasks," and "You will use these to craft important items later. Make sure to keep some." Prioritize your progression over short-term profit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>**Summary**</h2>
    <p>The LEDX is a rare item with significant economic and strategic value. By understanding its core uses for quests and your hideout, and by focusing your searches on reliable locations like the **Farmtown Pharmacies, Woods USEC Camp, and the Lab**, you can efficiently secure this vital item and advance your progress in *Escape from Duckov*. Good luck finding your "yellow duck"!</p>

        <p>
  In <a href="/">Escape from Duckov</a>, J-Lab Access Cards are crucial for gaining access to the restricted laboratories scattered throughout the Duckov suburbs.
  While the first entry-level card (J-Lab 1) is relatively easy to find, more advanced versions—including Level 2 cards and colored access cards (red, blue, green, purple, yellow, and black)—are much rarer and typically unlocked through deeper exploration, looting, and completing specific quests. Check our <a href="/items/key">keys database</a> for keycard information.
</p>

<p>
  This guide details how to find each J-Lab card, its confirmed spawn areas, and the best search routes to make your lab raids efficient and repeatable. For detailed <a href="/maps">map locations</a> and lab access points, visit our maps section.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>What are J-Lab Cards?</strong></h2>

<p>
  J-Lab Cards are security passes used to access underground research facilities located throughout the Duckov region.
  Different levels of cards grant access to deeper areas of the lab or color-coded containment zones associated with top-tier loot and lab equipment.
</p>

<p>Here's a brief description of each card type:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>J-Lab 1 Card</strong> – Basic-level access (access to standard lab areas)</li>
  <li><strong>J-Lab 2 Card</strong> – Intermediate-level access (access to areas B1 and below)</li>
  <li><strong>Colored Cards (Red, Blue, Green, Purple, Yellow, Black)</strong> – Advanced and optional keys used to unlock sealed wings or hidden lab areas</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike typical key items, these cards are <strong>consumable</strong>; one is consumed each time you enter the lab.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>J-Lab 1 Card – Basic Access</strong></h2>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>How to Obtain</strong></h3>

<p>
  In Escape from Duckov, there are two main ways to obtain your first J-Lab 1 Card:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Hidden Mine (Farm Town Area)</strong></li>
  <li>Search for card spawn points in the hidden mines near Farm Town. Cards may appear in corners, near mining equipment, or on walls. Cards respawn approximately every 4-5 game cycles, making them the best method of finding them in the early game.</li>
  <li><strong>Post-Quest Purchase: "Duplicate Pass"</strong></li>
  <li>Completing the "Duplicate Pass" side quest unlocks the merchant, Xiao Ming. After completing the mission, you can purchase J-Lab 1 Cards from Xiao Ming's shop for a fixed price. This is the most reliable way to restock.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Purpose</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>Open the entrance gate to J-Lab and begin your first official lab infiltration.</li>
  <li>Required for completing several early objectives related to the main storyline and loot milestones.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>J-Lab 2 Cards – Deeper Lab Access (Level B1)</strong></h2>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Where to Find It</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Lab B1 – Wanderer Drop</strong></li>
  <li>Level 2 Cards have a low chance of dropping from Wanderers on the B1 floor of the J-Lab complex after they are defeated. While the drop rate is low, consistently clearing the lab increases your chances of obtaining one.</li>
  <li><strong>Administrative Office Room Spawn</strong></li>
  <li>Some players have reported finding Level 2 Cards in the office on the first floor of the lab. Carefully inspect the room for desks, metal shelves, or computer terminals. These spawn points are not guaranteed to appear.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  <strong>Tips:</strong> Focus your search on areas patrolled by Wanderers, as they have the highest reported drop rate. Restarting a raid or switching servers may refresh the loot table, increasing your chances of finding a card.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Colored Access Cards</strong></h2>

<p>
  There are several ways to collect colored access cards for the Laboratory.
  One of the most effective methods is to search the <strong>Mysterious Key (X/O) room</strong>, where almost all cards and high-level supplies have a chance to spawn.
  However, the following cards have specific ways to obtain them:
</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Red Cards</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>A random drop after defeating the "?" boss in Farm Town.</li>
  <li>They may also spawn on the table in the northeast corner of the Blue Card room in the Laboratory.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Blue Cards</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>There is a chance of dropping them after defeating the Mine boss in Farm Town.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Green Cards</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>Spawn in two locations in the B2 Laboratory:</li>
  <li>On the west-facing chair in the small blue room across the hallway above the Yellow Card room.</li>
  <li>By the water fountain in the passage between the Jail and the Red Room.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Black Cards</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>The Mysterious Merchant in Farm Town may sell them for 200,000 credits.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Yellow Cards</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>May spawn in two locations in the Laboratory:</li>
  <li>On the table between the glass door of the Key Room and the facility entrance.</li>
  <li>On the table in the small room at the bottom left of the map (to the left of the extraction point).</li>
  <li><strong>PS:</strong> This card also drops from defeating the Mysterious Merchant in Farm Town. You can sneak attack him from behind the shipping container to his left.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Purple Cards</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>May spawn in the small house to the right of the Lumberyard in Farm Town.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  <img src="/images/guide/guide07-02.webp" alt="J-Lab Access Card (Purple)">
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Scouting and Development Strategy</strong></h2>

<p>For maximum efficiency, follow this route:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Start in Farm Town → Hidden Mine</strong></li>
  <li>While collecting loot and supplies, repeatedly search for J-Lab 1 cards, stocking up on at least 5-10.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete the "Duplicate Pass" quest.</strong></li>
  <li>Unlock Xiao Ming's shop to ensure a sustainable supply of J-Lab 1 cards.</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat J-Lab B1.</strong></li>
  <li>Focus on clearing enemies to obtain J-Lab 2 cards. Each complete clear increases your chances of receiving a rare drop.</li>
  <li><strong>Revisit Farm Town periodically.</strong></li>
  <li>Regularly check the Lumberyard, the Mysterious Merchant, and boss spawn points for purple, yellow, and other colored cards.</li>
  <li><strong>Save Premium Cards</strong></li>
  <li>Use colored cards only after you've identified your target room and are fully prepared. These cards are extremely valuable, so plan your exploration carefully.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Collecting all the J-Lab cards in Escape from Duckov requires patience and consistent exploration.
  While the basic cards can be easily replenished, the vibrantly colored premium cards are reserved for players who truly delve into the game world—exploring every corner, raiding every bunker, and piecing together scattered clues.
  Check our <a href="/wiki/quests">quest database</a> for missions related to J-Lab access. Explore more <a href="/guides">advanced guides</a> for comprehensive loot strategies. Good luck!

      <p>
  One of the early missions you'll receive in <a href="/">Escape from Duckov</a> is the <strong>"Hunter's Path"</strong> quest, which tasks you with hunting down and eliminating some of the wasteland's more aggressive inhabitants: Rampaging Scavengers. This guide will show you exactly where to find these nimble foes, how to kill them efficiently, and how to complete the quest. Check our <a href="/wiki/quests">quest database</a> for all available missions.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>Step 1: Where to Find Rampaging Scavengers</strong>
</h2>

<p>
  Unlike other enemies that roam randomly, Rampaging Scavengers are found in a specific, fixed location. You won't stumble upon them in the middle of the main path; you need to seek out their camp.
</p>

<h4 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>Location:</strong>
</h4>

<p>
  The Rampaging Scavenger camp is located in a clearing in the <strong>southwest corner of the map</strong>, just south of the main Forest Path. For detailed <a href="/maps">map information</a>, visit our maps section.
  <img src="/images/guide/guide08-02.webp" alt="Rampaging Scavenger2">
</p>

<h4 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>How to Get There:</strong>
</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Start from the main bunker entrance and head west along the dirt path.</li>
  <li>Keep to the left side of the path. You will soon see a <strong>break in the wire fence line</strong> that leads south into a wooded area.</li>
  <li>Follow this small detour path south into the clearing. You can't miss the camp from here.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Once you enter their camp, you will immediately spot them. They are easily identifiable by their bright red clothing and the menacing butcher knives they wield. Typically, you will find <strong>two to three scavengers</strong> spawned in this camp at any given time.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Warning:</strong> Be cautious! Once they spot you, Rampaging Scavengers are incredibly fast and will chase you relentlessly, potentially all the way back to the bunker. Do not underestimate their pursuit.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>Step 2: How to Quickly Kill Rampaging Scavengers</strong>
</h2>

<p>
  The key to dealing with these enemies is speed and precision. They will sprint directly at you to engage in fast, damaging melee combat that inflicts a bleeding status effect.
</p>

<h4 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>The Best Strategy: Aim for the Head</strong>
</h4>

<p>
  <img src="/images/guide/guide08-03.webp" alt="Rampaging Scavenger2">
</p>

<p>
  The single most effective way to kill a Rampaging Scavenger is with a clean headshot. This neutralizes them instantly, preventing them from closing the distance and causing you harm.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Recommended Weapons:</strong> Use a precision weapon like a pistol or a rifle. Browse our <a href="/items/weapons">weapons database</a> to find the best firearms for this encounter. Avoid shotguns, as their spread may not be effective at a distance, and do not attempt to fight them with melee weapons.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep Your Distance:</strong> Do not let them get close. As soon as you spot them, take your position and aim carefully.</li>
  <li><strong>Beware of the Environment:</strong> You will notice red explosive barrels in their camp. While you can shoot these to cause an explosion, it's a risky strategy. Once they are alerted, they will sprint towards you, likely moving out of the blast radius before it can do significant damage. It is safer to rely on direct shots.</li>
  <li><strong>Prepare for the Aftermath:</strong> Even if you kill them quickly, you might take a hit. <strong>Bring bandages</strong> to stop any bleeding effects you may suffer during the fight.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>Step 3: Completing the Hunter's Path Quest</strong>
</h2>

<p>
  Once you have dealt with the scavengers, the final step is to complete the quest objectives.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Kill Two Scavengers:</strong> Ensure you have killed at least two Rampaging Scavengers.</li>
  <li><strong>Loot Their Butcher Knives:</strong> Approach the bodies of the scavengers you killed and loot the <strong>"Butcher Knife"</strong> from each of them. You need two knives for the quest.</li>
  <li><strong>Return to the Bunker:</strong> With the knives in your inventory, safely make your way back to the bunker and turn in the quest to complete it.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>Follow these steps, and you'll have the Hunter's Path quest completed in no time. Good luck out there.</em>

    <p>
  In the world of <a href="/">Escape from Duckov</a>, you'll come across many items. Some are for crafting, some for selling, and some, like the Tote Bag, have a very specific and crucial purpose that isn't immediately obvious. Many new players make the mistake of selling this "luxury item" for a quick profit, not realizing they are discarding an essential tool for obtaining one of the game's unique boss drops. Browse our <a href="/items">items database</a> to learn about all special items.
</p>

<p>
  This guide covers what the Tote Bag does, where to find it, and why you should absolutely keep it.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>What is the Tote Bag?</strong>
</h2>

<p>
  The Tote Bag is a unique piece of equipment with very specific properties that set it apart from standard backpacks.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="/images/guide/guide09-02.webp" alt="tote-bag1">
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Item Type:</strong> Luxury Item</li>
  <li><strong>Acquisition:</strong> Found as random environmental loot (cannot be purchased).</li>
  <li><strong>Stackable:</strong> No</li>
  <li><strong>Key Feature:</strong> It contains a single, special storage slot labeled <strong>“?”</strong>. This slot is the entire reason for the bag's existence.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Unlike other bags, the Tote Bag provides no general inventory bonus, such as extra capacity or weight limit. Its value is entirely functional. Compare it with other <a href="/items/equipment">backpacks and storage items</a> in our equipment database.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>Where to Find the Tote Bag</strong>
</h2>

<p>
  There is no single, guaranteed location to find a Tote Bag. Its acquisition is entirely based on luck and thorough exploration.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Spawn Location:</strong> Appears as random <strong>environmental loot</strong> scattered throughout the game world.</li>
  <li><strong>How to Find:</strong> The best way to increase your chances of finding one is to be meticulous during your raids. <strong>Thoroughly search buildings, containers, and loot caches</strong> across any map. Eventually, you will stumble upon one.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Once you find a Tote Bag, <strong>do not sell it</strong>. Store it safely in your hideout's warehouse until you are ready to use it.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>The True Purpose: How to Use the Tote Bag</strong>
</h2>

<p>
  The Tote Bag is the only tool that allows you to transport a special item dropped by a specific boss.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The Boss:</strong> In <strong>Farm Town</strong>, there is a unique boss known as the <strong>"Red Blob Boss."</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The Drop:</strong> When defeated, this boss drops a mysterious item called the <strong>Red Eye</strong> (originally identified as "??? Glowing eye").</li>
  <li><strong>The Mechanic:</strong> You <strong>cannot pick up the Red Eye through normal means</strong>. If you try to loot it like a standard item, it won't work.</li>
  <li><strong>The Solution:</strong> To transport the Red Eye, you must have the <strong>Tote Bag</strong> in your inventory. You then interact with the Red Eye and place it directly into the Tote Bag's special <strong>"?"</strong> slot. Only then can you carry it back to your base.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The Red Eye itself provides a powerful and lasting enhancement when used, making the Tote Bag an essential item for any player looking to farm this boss for its unique reward.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>Tote Bag vs. Decoration Bag: What's the Difference?</strong>
</h2>

<p>
  It's crucial to understand that the Tote Bag is a tool, not a backpack. For general loot runs, the Decoration Bag is the superior choice.

  <strong>When to Use Which:</strong>
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use the <strong>Decoration Bag</strong> for all your normal loot runs where you need to maximize carrying capacity.</li>
  <li>
    Use the <strong>Tote Bag</strong> <em>only</em> when you are specifically planning to hunt the Red Blob Boss in Farm Town and need to extract the Red Eye.

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">
  <strong>Why You Should Never Sell the Tote Bag</strong>
</h2>

<p>
  Selling the Tote Bag is a common mistake for new players who don't understand its unique function. Because it's classified as a "luxury item" and has no obvious stats, it can seem like vendor trash.
</p>

<p>
  However, the Tote Bag is an essential, non-purchasable tool required for repeatedly hunting the Red Blob Boss and acquiring the valuable Red Eye. If you plan on engaging with this content, you need to keep the bag.
</p>

<p>
  If you have already sold yours, don't panic. Just be sure to keep the next one you find—you will need it later. For more item guides and boss strategies, explore our <a href="/guides">complete guides collection</a>.

        <p>Fishing is an essential survival mechanic in <a href="/">Escape from Duckov</a> that provides valuable resources and quest completion items. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about fishing mechanics, bait preparation, fishing rod usage, and mastering the challenging QTE mini-game.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Bait Preparation and Crafting</h2>
        
        <h3>Basic Bait Crafting</h3>
        <p><strong>Standard Bait Recipe:</strong> Common fishing bait can be crafted at the workbench using 3 Earthworms + 2 Cookies. This is the primary method for obtaining bait in the early game.</p>
        <p><strong>Fishing Store Purchase:</strong> After completing a certain number of fishing quests (specifically the "Path of the Fish King 3" quest), you can purchase bait directly from the fishing store, making bait acquisition much more convenient. Check our <a href="/wiki/quests">quest database</a> for all fishing-related missions.</p>
        
        <h3>Obtaining Earthworms</h3>
        <p><strong>Digging Requirements:</strong> To collect earthworms, you need to have a shovel in your inventory (no equipment slot required). Earthworms are obtained by searching digging points scattered across various maps.</p>
        <p><strong>Digging Point Locations:</strong> Digging points appear at fixed locations on each map. Search these spots while carrying a shovel to harvest earthworms.</p>
        <p><strong>Yield Rate:</strong> Each digging point yields 1-3 earthworms, so multiple digging points may be needed to gather sufficient materials for bait crafting.</p>
        <p>For a complete list of <a href="/items/fish">fishing items and equipment</a>, visit our comprehensive fishing database.</p>
        
        <h3>Cookie Acquisition Strategy</h3>
        <p><strong>Vending Machine Source:</strong> Cookies can be purchased from vending machines, which refresh every 5 minutes. Each purchase yields 2 cookies.</p>
        <p><strong>Recommended Habit:</strong> Develop a routine of purchasing cookies every time you return to your base. This ensures you always have cookies available for bait crafting without having to wait for machine refreshes.</p>
        <p><strong>Resource Planning:</strong> Since cookies refresh on a timer, consistent purchases prevent delays when you need to craft bait urgently for fishing sessions.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Fishing Rod Equipment and Setup</h2>
        
        <h3>Fishing Rod Requirements</h3>
        <p><strong>Equipment Slot:</strong> You must equip a fishing rod to engage in fishing activities. Ensure you have an appropriate fishing rod in your equipment inventory.</p>
        <p><strong>Bait Attachment:</strong> Bait must be equipped to the fishing rod as an attachment/accessory. Configure your fishing rod with the desired bait before approaching fishing spots.</p>
        <p>Browse our <a href="/items/fish">complete fishing equipment database</a> to view all available fishing rods and their specifications.</p>
        
        <h3>Fishing Spot Activation</h3>
        <p><strong>Location Requirements:</strong> Fishing spots are located at fixed positions on each map. Navigate to these designated areas to begin fishing.</p>
        <p><strong>Activation Method:</strong> Press F when positioned at a fishing spot to enter fishing mode. Ensure you're at the correct location and have your fishing rod equipped before pressing the activation key.</p>
        <p><strong>Map Distribution:</strong> For detailed information about fishing spot distribution across different maps, refer to our <a href="/maps">interactive maps section</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Fishing Mini-Game Mechanics</h2>
        
        <h3>Fish Bite Indicators</h3>
        <p><strong>Warning Sign:</strong> When a fish takes the bait, an exclamation mark "!" appears near the fishing rod as a visual prompt. This indicates that a fish has bitten and the QTE sequence is about to begin.</p>
        <p><strong>Timing Window:</strong> Approximately 1 second after the exclamation mark appears, the QTE (Quick Time Event) will activate. Pay close attention to timing your response correctly.</p>
        
        <h3>QTE Sequence</h3>
        <p><strong>Circle Mechanics:</strong> The fishing mini-game displays two concentric circles - an outer circle that shrinks inward toward an inner circle. Your goal is to press the spacebar when the two circles overlap perfectly.</p>
        <p><strong>Success Condition:</strong> Pressing spacebar when the circles align results in a successful catch and the fish is added to your inventory.</p>
        <p><strong>Failure Consequence:</strong> Missing the timing or pressing spacebar too early/late results in fishing failure. Importantly, one bait is consumed regardless of success or failure, making accurate timing crucial for resource conservation.</p>
        
        <h3>Difficulty and Mod Recommendations</h3>
        <p><strong>Challenge Assessment:</strong> The fishing mini-game is quite challenging due to its precise timing requirements and the cost of failed attempts.</p>
        <p><strong>Mod Usage:</strong> Players are strongly recommended to install a fishing mod to make the mini-game more manageable, especially during the early game when bait resources are limited. Browse our <a href="/mods">mods collection</a> to find helpful fishing mods.</p>
        <p><strong>Alternative Method:</strong> Alternatively, using Cheat Engine (CE) to adjust game speed can lower the difficulty by providing more time to react during the QTE sequence.</p>
        <p><strong>Resource Conservation:</strong> Since bait cannot be purchased initially and crafting requires significant effort, losing bait to failed fishing attempts carries a substantial cost. Mods or speed adjustments help minimize unnecessary bait loss.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Fishing Notes and Information System</h2>
        
        <h3>Fishing Notes Discovery</h3>
        <p><strong>Note Locations:</strong> Fishing notes can be found near fishing spots throughout the game world. These notes contain valuable information about fish behavior and requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Note Content:</strong> Fishing notes provide details about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weather conditions required for specific fish to appear</li>
            <li>Bait types needed to catch particular fish species</li>
            <li>Time-of-day preferences for different fish</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Accessing Fishing Notes</h3>
        <p><strong>Collection:</strong> Pick up fishing notes when you encounter them near fishing spots. Collected notes are automatically added to your information database.</p>
        <p><strong>Review Method:</strong> Open your inventory (TAB key) and navigate to the notes section to review all collected fishing information. This helps you plan fishing sessions based on current weather conditions and available bait.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Special Fish and Quest Requirements</h2>
        
        <h3>Whiteback Fish (Path of the Fish King 3)</h3>
        <p><strong>Quest Requirement:</strong> The "Path of the Fish King 3" quest specifically requires the Whiteback Fish as a quest item. View this and other fishing quests in our <a href="/wiki/quests">complete quest database</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Weather Condition:</strong> Whiteback Fish only appears during rainy weather conditions. You cannot catch this fish during clear or other weather conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Fishing Strategy:</strong> Monitor weather patterns and plan your fishing sessions accordingly. Wait for rain before attempting to catch the Whiteback Fish to avoid wasting bait on unsuccessful attempts.</p>
        <p>Check our <a href="/items/fish">complete fish database</a> for detailed information about all catchable fish species and their requirements.</p>
        
        <h3>Alternative Bait Options</h3>
        <p><strong>Special Bait Items:</strong> In addition to standard crafted bait, certain items can be used as alternative bait with specific effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>R6 Battery:</strong> Can be used as bait to catch specific fish species</li>
            <li><strong>Lighter:</strong> Functions as bait for certain fish types</li>
            <li><strong>Toilet Cleaner:</strong> Acts as specialized bait for corresponding fish species</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Experimentation:</strong> Try using different items as bait to discover which fish they attract. Fishing notes may provide hints about these alternative bait options.</p>
        <p>For comprehensive information about <a href="/items/fish">baits and fishing equipment</a>, visit our detailed fishing items guide.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Fishing Spot Information and Distribution</h2>
        
        <h3>Map-Specific Fishing Spots</h3>
        <p><strong>Location Variety:</strong> Each map in Escape from Duckov contains specific fishing spots with different fish spawn rates and species availability.</p>
        <p><strong>Spot Distribution:</strong> For detailed information about fishing spot locations and distribution on each map, please refer to our <a href="/maps">interactive maps section</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Understanding fishing spot locations helps you plan efficient routes that combine fishing with other activities like looting or quest completion.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Weather and Time-Based Fishing</h2>
        
        <h3>Weather Conditions</h3>
        <p><strong>Weather Impact:</strong> Different fish species appear based on weather conditions. Some fish only spawn during specific weather patterns (rain, clear skies, etc.).</p>
        <p><strong>Weather Monitoring:</strong> Pay attention to weather changes in the game. Use fishing notes and experience to determine the best weather conditions for your target fish.</p>
        
        <h3>Time-of-Day Factors</h3>
        <p><strong>Temporal Variations:</strong> The types of fish you can catch vary depending on the time of day. Different fish may be more active during morning, afternoon, or evening hours.</p>
        <p><strong>Optimization Strategy:</strong> Combine weather and time-of-day information to maximize your fishing success rate. Plan fishing sessions during optimal conditions for your target species.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Resource Management and Optimization</h2>
        
        <h3>Bait Conservation</h3>
        <p><strong>Early Game Scarcity:</strong> Bait cannot be purchased initially, making each bait valuable. Craft bait efficiently and avoid wasting it on poorly timed fishing attempts.</p>
        <p><strong>Crafting Efficiency:</strong> Maintain a steady supply of earthworms and cookies through regular collection and purchases. Don't let your bait stock run low.</p>
        
        <h3>Fishing Efficiency Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mod Usage:</strong> Consider installing fishing mods to reduce bait waste during learning phases</li>
            <li><strong>Weather Planning:</strong> Only fish during appropriate weather conditions for your target species</li>
            <li><strong>Note Collection:</strong> Prioritize collecting fishing notes to optimize your fishing strategies</li>
            <li><strong>Cookie Stockpiling:</strong> Buy cookies consistently to maintain bait crafting capability</li>
            <li><strong>Equipment Preparation:</strong> Always ensure your fishing rod is properly equipped with bait before heading to fishing spots</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>9. Advanced Fishing Strategies</h2>
        
        <h3>Quest-Focused Fishing</h3>
        <p><strong>Quest Preparation:</strong> Before accepting fishing-related quests, check weather forecasts and prepare appropriate bait. Some quests require specific fish that only appear under certain conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficient Completion:</strong> Complete multiple fishing objectives in a single session when weather conditions align with multiple quest requirements.</p>
        
        <h3>Resource Diversification</h3>
        <p><strong>Multiple Bait Types:</strong> Experiment with different bait types (crafted bait, R6 batteries, lighters, toilet cleaner) to discover optimal combinations for different fish species.</p>
        <p><strong>Alternative Methods:</strong> Don't limit yourself to standard bait. Explore special item baits for potentially better catch rates on specific fish.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    What to Keep &amp; What to Sell
  </em>
</p>

<p>We’ve all been there. You finish a great raid, your backpack is bursting with loot, and you get back to your bunker only to face the true final boss of this game: <strong>Inventory Management.</strong></p>

<p>Your stash is full, every slot is precious, and you're paralyzed by the fear of selling that one random item you’ll desperately need for a quest three weeks from now.</p>

<p>Let's be real: <strong>You can't keep everything.</strong> Learning what to hoard and what to turn into cold, hard cash is one of the most important skills in this game. So, let's break it down.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">The Golden Rules of Looting</h2>

<p>Before we get into lists, let's start with a mindset.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Embrace the Sell Button:</strong> Selling isn't failure; it's progress. Every useless item you sell is cash that can be turned into better ammo, armor, or that gun part you've been eyeing.</li>
  <li><strong>Know Your Needs:</strong> The most important items are the ones <em>you</em> need right now. Make a habit of checking your upgrade stations in the bunker to see what materials are required. Mark those items mentally (or physically!) as "hands-off."</li>
  <li><strong>The "One of Each" Rule:</strong> When in doubt, keep at least one of every unique item you find. If you find a second one and don't have an immediate use for it, that’s a good candidate for selling.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">The "Never Sell" List: Hoard These Like Your Life Depends On It</h2>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;">Quest &amp; Upgrade Essentials:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Feathers and Cores: The lifeblood of your progression. Use them, cherish them, never sell them.</li>
  <li>Warehouse Upgrade Crates: Self-explanatory. More space is the ultimate prize.</li>
  <li>Dog Tags: You will need an absolutely massive pile of these for a later storage upgrade. Start your collection now.</li>
  <li>Boss Drops: Keep at least one of every item dropped by a boss. They are often required for late-game quests and upgrades.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;">High-Value Intelligence:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Graphics Cards &amp; Black Market Notebooks: These are high-value items often needed for quests or high-tier barters. Hold onto them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;">Combat Gear (The Good Stuff):</h3>

<ul>
  <li>AP Rifle Ammo: This stuff is rare and tears through armor. It's far more valuable to shoot than to sell.</li>
  <li>Special Grenades: Regular grenades can be bought, but the rare, special types should be saved for when you really need them.</li>
  <li>High-Tier Gear: Keep a few spare sets of Level 4-5 armor, backpacks, and kitted-out guns, especially if their durability is over 75%. Having a backup kit ready means you can jump back into a raid immediately after a loss.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;">Keys to the Kingdom:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All Keys: Find a key? Keep it. Register it. You never know which one will open a door to life-changing loot.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">The "Safe to Sell" List: Your Money-Makers</h2>

<p>Free up that precious space and line your pockets. These items are generally safe to offload.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Duplicate "Junk" Items:</strong> That tenth roll of duct tape or fifth screwdriver? Sell them. You'll find more.</li>
  <li><strong>Low-Tier Guns &amp; Armor:</strong> That basic pistol or cracked Level 2 vest from your first few raids? Sell it. It's taking up space you could use for something better.</li>
  <li><strong>Common Crafting Materials (in excess):</strong> While you should keep a healthy stock of things like gun parts, fabrics, and metal sheets, you don't need 10 full stacks of them. If you're overflowing, sell a few stacks.</li>
  <li><strong>Most Food and Water:</strong> Unless you need a specific type for an upgrade, food and drinks are plentiful. Don't let them clog your inventory.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">The Grey Area: Items to Think Twice About</h2>

<p>Some items aren't a simple keep-or-sell.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;">Trophies, Bike Models, and other "Toys"</h3>

<p>This is tricky. While most common trinkets are just vendor trash, <strong>DO NOT SELL TROPHIES.</strong> Trophies are often unique and required for specific, important tasks. For other toys, the "keep one" rule is your best friend until you know for sure.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;">The Tote Bag</h3>

<p>What’s the deal with this thing? It sells for a good price, but the community buzz is that it might have a secret use or interaction later. <strong>The Verdict:</strong> If you can spare the space, hold onto it. It feels too unique to be simple vendor trash.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;">Explosives (Grenades/Dynamite)</h3>

<p>It's easy to become an explosives hoarder. One player admitted:</p>

<blockquote>
  "more than 30% of my storage space is explosives (current space is 590 slots, i dont need to upgrade it further)"
</blockquote>

<p>Ask yourself honestly: do you need 50 dynamite sticks right now? Probably not. Keep a reasonable amount for your raids (maybe a stack or two) and sell the rest.</p>

<p>Finally, remember to <strong>open all Red Envelopes</strong> you find. They contain goodies you want now, not later.</p>

<p>Good luck out there, and happy looting (and selling)!</p>

    <p>Managing your loot is crucial for survival in <strong>Escape From Duckov</strong>. As you gather more gear and resources, your hideout's warehouse space will quickly become a limiting factor. <strong>Expansion Crates</strong> are the key to solving this problem, allowing you to permanently increase your storage capacity.</p>
<p>This guide will cover everything you need to know about finding these valuable crates and how to use them to expand your vault.</p>

<h2><strong>Part 1: How To Obtain Expansion Crates</strong></h2>
<p>Expansion Crates are rare items used to upgrade the size of your Warehouse at the hideout. While all storage upgrades require different materials, Expansion Crates are among the most important components.</p>
<p><img src="/images/guide/guide18-01.webp" alt="Expansion crate" width="100%" style="width: 100%;"></p>

<h3><strong>Where to Find Expansion Crates:</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lockers in Specific Areas:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mercenary Base:</strong> Many players report that they've found most of their expansion crates in the Mercenary Base. While this might be a coincidence, the area is definitely a **hotspot worth searching**.</li>
            <li><strong>The First Area:</strong> Even early in the game, you have a good chance of finding <strong>Expansion Box S</strong> and <strong>M</strong> in lockers throughout the first playable area.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Toolboxes:</strong> Toolboxes found across all regions have a strong chance to spawn expansion crates. **Never pass up a toolbox** during your runs.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>A Fast &amp; Efficient Early Farming Route:</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Enter the first area and head northwest through the portal, then continue upward.</li>
    <li>Sweep all the lockers along this path.</li>
    <li>Once you find an expansion crate, <strong>extract immediately</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This route keeps your risk low while focusing on high-yield containers, making it perfect for early-game farming.</p>

<h3><strong>Important Tips:</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Drops are RNG-Gated:</strong> Finding an expansion crate is based on luck (**RNG**), so expect a few empty runs between successful finds. **Patience is key.**</li>
    <li><strong>Watch Your Weight:</strong> Larger crates (especially M and L) are very heavy. If you're carrying one, **prioritize extraction** to avoid losing it in a fight.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many new players are confused when they first find an Expansion Box because it can't be "opened" or "used" like a normal item. Remember this key rule: <strong>Expansion Box S is a vault upgrade material, not a consumable.</strong> It is only consumed when you apply a specific vault upgrade.</p>

<h3><strong>Using Expansion Box S to Upgrade Your Warehouse (Step-by-Step):</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Bring the Box Back to Base:</strong> After finding a box, make sure it is in your **character's inventory** (your pockets or rig), not your warehouse storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Find the Storage NPC:</strong> At your hideout, go to the first NPC, <strong>Jeff</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Interact with the Locker:</strong> Interact with the main storage locker located behind him to open the storage UI.</li>
    <li><strong>Switch to the Upgrade Tab:</strong> In the storage UI, switch to the **"Storage Expansion" / "Upgrade Vault"** tab. On PC, you can use the on-screen tab switcher or your mouse wheel.</li>
    <li><strong>Select the Upgrade Tier:</strong> Select the next available vault upgrade tier. Early tiers may only cost credits, while later tiers will require items like Expansion Boxes.</li>
    <li><strong>Confirm the Upgrade:</strong> Confirm the action. The Expansion Box and the required credits will be consumed, and your warehouse capacity will increase immediately.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Troubleshooting: What to Do If the Upgrade Won't Work</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Is it in the right place?</strong> Make sure the box is in your **on-character inventory**, not your vault.</li>
    <li><strong>Are you on the right screen?</strong> Double-check that you are on the **"Upgrade Vault"** tab, not the regular storage view.</li>
    <li><strong>Does the tier require it?</strong> Confirm that the upgrade tier you are selecting actually lists **Expansion Box S** as a required material.</li>
    <li><strong>Do you have enough credits?</strong> Ensure you have the required amount of credits in addition to the box.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Warehouse vs. Backpack Capacity: A Key Distinction</strong></h2>
<p>It is important to understand that Expansion Boxes <strong>only increase your warehouse capacity at the hideout.</strong> They do not add slots to your mission loadout or increase your backpack size for raids.</p>
<p>If you want to carry more loot *during* a raid, you need to increase your <strong>backpack capacity</strong> through separate systems:</p>
<p><img src="/images/guide/guide18-04.webp" alt="Warehouse vs. Backpack Capacity" width="100%" style="width: 100%;"></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Skill Enhancement Machine:</strong> At your base, use this machine and choose the **"Backpack Expert"** upgrade line.</li>
    <li><strong>Specific Backpacks:</strong> Find special backpacks in the field that permanently add slots when equipped.</li>
    <li><strong>Body Armor:</strong> Certain pieces of body armor can also increase your carry capacity.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Step 1: How to Get the Mechanical Key</strong></h2>
<p>The truck containing the watch is locked, and the <strong>Mechanical Key</strong> is the only way inside.</p>
<p><img src="/images/guide/guide19-01.webp" alt="buy Key " width="100%" style="width: 100%;"></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Primary Method (Recommended):</strong> The most reliable way to get the key is to purchase it from the <strong>vending machine</strong> in your bunker/safehouse for <strong>660 currency</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative Method:</strong> It is possible to find the key as random loot in the world, but this is far less predictable. Buying it is the fastest way to proceed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> If you have built the <strong>Key Registration Device</strong> in your bunker, you can register the Mechanical Key before deploying. This prevents you from losing it if you die during the raid. If not, simply keep the key in your secure container or inventory.</p>
<p><img src="/images/guide/guide19-02.webp" alt="Mechanical Key" width="100%" style="width: 100%;"></p>

<h2><strong>Step 2: Finding the Bronze Pocket Watch Location on Ground Zero</strong></h2>
<p>The Bronze Pocket Watch is in a fixed location: inside the cab of a <strong>white truck attached to an orange fuel tanker</strong>. You will find this truck in the <strong>southeastern corner of Ground Zero</strong>, parked in a pile-up of abandoned vehicles across the river.</p>
<p>The easiest landmark to navigate by is the <strong>sewer exit</strong>. The truck is located just a short distance east of this exit.</p>
<p><img src="/images/guide/guide19-03.webp" alt="Mechanical Key" width="100%" style="width: 100%;"></p>

<h3><strong>Two Reliable Routes to the Truck:</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Bridge Route:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>From the bunker entrance, head east toward the broken wooden bridge.</li>
            <li>You will need <strong>2 Wood</strong> to repair it. (Wood can be found in toolboxes or purchased).</li>
            <li>Cross the bridge and follow the vehicle-clogged road south to find the tanker.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk:</strong> This route is more exposed and can attract scavengers. The southern bridge is generally quieter.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>The Sewer Route (Fastest &amp; Safest):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have previously unlocked the sewer hatch, this is by far the best route.</li>
            <li>Surface at the Ground Zero sewer exit.</li>
            <li>The truck and tanker will be almost immediately in front of you, just a few meters to the east.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you reach the truck, approach the <strong>driver-side door</strong> and use the Mechanical Key from your inventory to unlock it. The Bronze Pocket Watch will be inside.</p>

<h2><strong>Step 3: The Easiest Extraction</strong></h2>
<p>You don't need to run back across the map to extract. One of the best extraction points is located right next to the objective.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Look for a <strong>manhole cover</strong> on the ground, just to the left of the tanker truck.</li>
    <li>There may be a cardboard box on top of it. Simply move the box to clear the hatch.</li>
    <li>Interacting with the open hatch provides a direct and safe shortcut back to your bunker's cellar.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Step 4: Turn-in and Rewards</strong></h2>
<p>After successfully extracting with the Bronze Pocket Watch, return to the bunker. Speak to <strong>Xavier</strong> and hand over the watch to complete the quest.</p>
<p>Completing this task will reward you with XP and currency, and it will unlock the next quest in his storyline, <strong>"Cargo List."</strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/guide/guide19-04.webp" alt="hand over the watch" width="100%" style="width: 100%;"></p>

<h2><strong>Troubleshooting &amp; FAQ</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Is the watch spawn guaranteed?</strong>
        <p><strong>Yes.</strong> The Bronze Pocket Watch is a fixed quest item. If you unlock the door and don't see it, it's likely a rare bug. Simply leave Ground Zero and re-enter the map to reset it.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>What happens if I die?</strong>
        <p>Dying will reset your quest progress. You will have to go back into Ground Zero to retrieve the watch again. This is why using the quick manhole extraction is highly recommended.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Why is this quest important?</strong>
        <p>It provides a great early-game boost of XP and currency, teaches essential skills, and unlocks further quests to progress your main storyline.</p>
    </li>
