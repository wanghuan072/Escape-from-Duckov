        <p><strong>Equipment Safety:</strong> This system prevents loss of valuable equipment during inventory management operations.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Crafting and Resource Tracking</h3>
        
        <h4>Item Marking System</h4>
        <p><strong>Material Tracking:</strong> In crafting and upgrade interfaces, press N on required materials to add heart icons next to them. This visual system helps track quest items and crafting requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Quest Integration:</strong> Marked items are easily identifiable during looting, streamlining quest completion and resource gathering.</p>
        
        <h4>Dismantling Mechanics</h4>
        <p><strong>Resource Conversion:</strong> Many items (including Rusty Bullets and plastic components) can be dismantled into basic materials like Gunpowder for crafting or quest submission.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency Strategy:</strong> Regular dismantling maximizes resource utilization and provides materials for advanced crafting projects.</p>
        
        <h2>II. Character Development and Progression</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Attribute Enhancement and Perks</h3>
        
        <h4>Perk Palace System</h4>
        <p><strong>Core Progression:</strong> The Perk Palace serves as the primary character advancement system, offering permanent buffs through Cash and Core Fragment investment.</p>
        <p><strong>Priority Recommendation:</strong> Backpack Expert provides additional weight capacity and storage space - the most valuable early-game investment for expedition efficiency.</p>
        
        <h4>Physical Training</h4>
        <p><strong>Mud's Training:</strong> Visit Mud in the gym to access physical training programs that permanently increase attributes like maximum health.</p>
        <p><strong>Long-term Benefits:</strong> Physical training provides permanent stat improvements, making it a worthwhile investment for character development.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Survival and Medical Systems</h3>
        
        <h4>Healing Item Categories</h4>
        <p><strong>Health Restoration:</strong> Bandages and First Aid Kits restore health points and are essential for combat survival.</p>
        <p><strong>Pain Management:</strong> Aspirin relieves pain but causes dehydration - monitor water intake after usage.</p>
        <p><strong>Bleeding Control:</strong> Herat serves as hemostatic medicine, specifically designed to treat bleeding status effects.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Movement and Combat Mechanics</h3>
        
        <h4>Speed Optimization</h4>
        <p><strong>Weapon Holstering:</strong> Press C to holster your weapon, increasing movement speed - particularly effective when carrying rifles or heavy weapons.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic Mobility:</strong> Holstering weapons is crucial for quick repositioning and escape scenarios.</p>
        
        <h4>Evasion Techniques</h4>
        <p><strong>Dodge Rolling:</strong> Use the spacebar for dodge rolls when fighting melee enemies. This is essential for avoiding fatal attacks from Rampaging Scavengers.</p>
        <p><strong>Timing Critical:</strong> Master the timing of dodge rolls to maximize survival against high-damage melee opponents.</p>
        
        <h2>III. Combat Systems and Equipment</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Firearm Mechanics and Damage</h3>
        
        <h4>Ammunition Types</h4>
        <p><strong>Caliber Variety:</strong> Different firearms use specific ammunition types (S, L, AR rounds). Early weapons like Glick use S rounds, while AK-74U requires AR rounds.</p>
        <p><strong>Rusty Bullets:</strong> Common early ammunition with reduced damage output - requires more shots to eliminate enemies effectively.</p>
        
        <h4>Range and Accuracy</h4>
        <p><strong>Distance Indicator:</strong> The UI displays a range indicator in the lower right corner, showing optimal weapon effectiveness.</p>
        <p><strong>Color Coding:</strong> Green/White indicates effective range with maximum damage, while Red signals reduced damage due to range or accuracy issues.</p>
        <p><strong>Attachment Effects:</strong> Weapon modifications like suppressors and muzzle brakes directly impact range effectiveness and damage output.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Enemy Behavior and Tactics</h3>
        
        <h4>Rampaging Scavengers</h4>
        <p><strong>Melee Threats:</strong> High-damage melee enemies with clear attack patterns. Red flash warnings precede weapon swings - your signal to dodge roll.</p>
        <p><strong>Combat Strategy:</strong> Maintain distance and use dodge rolls to avoid their devastating melee attacks.</p>
        
        <h4>Environmental Advantages</h4>
        <p><strong>Cover Utilization:</strong> Sandbags provide excellent cover. Enemies, especially ranged attackers, have difficulty hitting targets behind sandbag barriers.</p>
        <p><strong>Positioning Strategy:</strong> Use terrain features to minimize enemy accuracy and maximize your combat effectiveness.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Equipment and Protection</h3>
        
        <h4>Armor Systems</h4>
        <p><strong>Damage Reduction:</strong> Armor and helmets provide direct damage mitigation. Advanced equipment like SWAT Helmets significantly improve early-game survivability.</p>
        <p><strong>Durability Management:</strong> All equipment has durability ratings. Damaged items can be repaired at repair workbenches using currency.</p>
        
        <h2>IV. Exploration and Economic Systems</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Extraction Mechanics</h3>
        
        <h4>Ground Zero Specificity</h4>
        <p><strong>Unique Extraction:</strong> Ground Zero doesn't require reaching designated extraction points. Simply return to the base entrance for safe extraction.</p>
        <p><strong>Other Maps:</strong> Most locations require finding extraction points marked with green smoke or locating special exit points.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Specialized Storage Solutions</h3>
        
        <h4>Pet Slot Functionality</h4>
        <p><strong>Heavy Item Storage:</strong> Located above your backpack, the Pet Slot is designed for heavy or extremely valuable items you cannot afford to lose.</p>
        <p><strong>Weight Exemption:</strong> Items in the Pet Slot don't contribute to your total weight, making it ideal for Car Batteries, large cash amounts, and critical quest items.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Trading and Commerce</h3>
        
        <h4>Mysterious Merchant</h4>
        <p><strong>Fixed Location Trading:</strong> Located at a specific Ground Zero position, this merchant accepts Cash for rare quest items including Honey, Pens, and IV Medicine.</p>
        <p><strong>Preparation Requirement:</strong> You must bring Cash into the map before entering to trade with the Mysterious Merchant.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Map Expansion and Shortcuts</h3>
        
        <h4>Sewer Access</h4>
        <p><strong>Secondary Route:</strong> Unlocked by removing obstacles on specific roads after bridge repairs, providing alternative Ground Zero access points.</p>
        
        <h4>Teleportation System</h4>
        <p><strong>Unlock Method:</strong> Use Dynamite to detonate the cracked wall outside your base entrance.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic Value:</strong> Creates a two-way teleportation shortcut, enabling instant travel between map endpoints - the most crucial early-game unlock for efficient corpse recovery and expedition management.</p>
        
        <h2>V. Risk Management and Death Systems</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Death Penalties and Recovery</h3>
        
        <h4>Item Loss Mechanics</h4>
        <p><strong>Complete Loss:</strong> Death results in loss of all carried items, making risk assessment crucial for expedition planning.</p>
        <p><strong>Corpse Recovery:</strong> Your items remain in a corpse bag at your death location, requiring re-entry to recover them.</p>
        
        <h4>Second Death Risk</h4>
        <p><strong>Permanent Loss:</strong> Dying again before recovering your corpse bag results in permanent loss of all previous items.</p>
        <p><strong>Recovery Strategy:</strong> Travel light and use the fastest route when recovering corpse bags to minimize risk.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Risk Mitigation Strategies</h3>
        
        <h4>Teleportation Advantage</h4>
        <p><strong>Quick Recovery:</strong> The Teleport Bubble (Dynamite shortcut) is essential for rapid corpse recovery and risk reduction.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Plan expeditions with corpse recovery routes in mind, prioritizing safety over speed.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Mastering these core mechanics is essential for success in Escape from Duckov. Focus on efficient base management, strategic character development, and careful risk assessment. The systems work together to create a challenging but rewarding survival experience where preparation and knowledge are your greatest assets.</p>

        detailsHtml: `
        <p>This comprehensive guide covers the complete process of accessing Duckov's most dangerous area - the Storm Zone. Learn how to activate power systems, acquire necessary certificates, defeat the Roadblock boss, and prepare for extreme endgame challenges.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Facility Power Activation</h2>
        
        <h3>Ground Floor Power Switch</h3>
        <p><strong>Initial Activation:</strong> Navigate to the ground floor and locate the first power breaker. This is your starting point for the entire power activation sequence.</p>
        <p><strong>Rogue Patrols:</strong> Stay extremely alert - heavily armed Rogues patrol this area with high-damage weapons and armor-piercing ammunition. These enemies can eliminate unprepared players quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>Combat Preparation:</strong> Ensure you have adequate ammunition and medical supplies before engaging. Rogues are significantly more dangerous than standard enemies.</p>
        
        <h3>Basement Power Switch</h3>
        <p><strong>Hazardous Descent:</strong> After activating the first breaker, proceed to the basement to activate the second power switch. This area contains environmental hazards that require careful navigation.</p>
        <p><strong>Yellow Stim Usage:</strong> Use a Yellow Stim to enhance your movement speed and dash through dangerous sections safely. This temporary buff is essential for surviving the hazardous basement area.</p>
        <p><strong>Quick Exit Strategy:</strong> Once power is activated, avoid lingering in the basement. The activated power systems may trigger additional hazards or enemy spawns.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Tier 2 Certificate Acquisition</h2>
        
        <h3>Certificate Spawn Locations</h3>
        <p><strong>Primary Location:</strong> The Tier 2 certificate can spawn inside the Projection Room - check all containers and surfaces thoroughly.</p>
        <p><strong>Secondary Location:</strong> Alternative spawn point is located directly outside the Projection Room door. Search the immediate area if not found inside.</p>
        <p><strong>Search Strategy:</strong> Methodically check both locations as the certificate is essential for progression to higher-tier content.</p>
        
        <h3>Stealth Monster Threats</h3>
        <p><strong>Invisible Predators:</strong> Stealth monsters patrol the Projection Room area and possess the ability to instantly eliminate players wearing Tier 4 armor.</p>
        <p><strong>One-Shot Capability:</strong> These enemies can kill even heavily armored players with a single attack, making them extremely dangerous.</p>
        <p><strong>Clearance Strategy:</strong> Eliminate all nearby Rogues before attempting to loot the certificate. This ensures safer access to the spawn locations.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Roadblock Boss Encounter</h2>
        
        <h3>Boss Preparation</h3>
        <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ensure both power breakers have been activated before attempting the Roadblock encounter. The boss will only spawn with full power activation.</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Return to the first floor after completing power activation to challenge the Roadblock boss.</p>
        <p><strong>Equipment Check:</strong> Verify you have sufficient ammunition, medical supplies, and appropriate armor before engaging.</p>
        
        <h3>Boss Mechanics and Strategy</h3>
        <p><strong>Guaranteed Reward:</strong> Roadblock always drops the Tier 3 certificate upon defeat - this is your guaranteed reward for completing the encounter.</p>
        <p><strong>Combat Approach:</strong> Use cover effectively and maintain distance. Roadblock's attacks are devastating at close range.</p>
        <p><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Conserve ammunition and medical supplies throughout the fight. The encounter can be lengthy and resource-intensive.</p>
        
        <h3>Post-Boss Extraction</h3>
        <p><strong>Certificate Collection:</strong> Immediately collect the Tier 3 certificate from Roadblock's corpse.</p>
        <p><strong>Extraction Route:</strong> Move quickly to the designated extraction zone after defeating the boss. Delaying extraction increases the risk of additional enemy encounters.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Storm Zone Entry</h2>
        
        <h3>Gateway Access</h3>
        <p><strong>Certificate Requirement:</strong> With the Tier 3 certificate in your possession, return to Sector 0 to locate the Storm Zone gateway.</p>
        <p><strong>Entry Process:</strong> Present the certificate at the gateway to gain access to Duckov's most dangerous area.</p>
        <p><strong>Point of No Return:</strong> Once inside the Storm Zone, extraction becomes significantly more challenging.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Storm Zone Preparation and Risks</h2>
        
        <h3>Extreme Danger Assessment</h3>
        <p><strong>Enemy Equipment:</strong> Expect enemies equipped with Tier 6 gear - the highest tier equipment in the game.</p>
        <p><strong>Combat Difficulty:</strong> All enemies inside the Storm Zone are significantly more powerful than those encountered in other areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Survival Challenge:</strong> The Storm Zone represents the ultimate test of player skill, equipment, and preparation.</p>
        
        <h3>Essential Preparation Items</h3>
        <p><strong>Storm Stim Requirement:</strong> Bring at least five Storm Stims before entering. These specialized consumables are essential for countering Storm Zone hazards.</p>
        <p><strong>Equipment Standards:</strong> Ensure your loadout includes the best available weapons, armor, and consumables.</p>
        <p><strong>Extended Combat Readiness:</strong> Prepare for prolonged engagements with top-tier enemies. Standard equipment may prove insufficient.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Key Terminology and Items</h2>
        
        <h3>Certificate System</h3>
        <p><strong>Tier 2 Certificate:</strong> Required for accessing mid-tier content and progressing toward higher difficulty areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Tier 3 Certificate:</strong> Mandatory key item for Storm Zone access, guaranteed drop from Roadblock boss encounter.</p>
        
        <h3>Enemy Classifications</h3>
        <p><strong>Rogues:</strong> AI opponents with high-end weapons and armor-piercing ammunition, significantly more dangerous than standard enemies.</p>
        <p><strong>Stealth Monsters:</strong> Deadly invisible enemies capable of instant kills, found around the Projection Room area.</p>
        
        <h3>Consumable Items</h3>
        <p><strong>Yellow Stim:</strong> Temporary movement buff ideal for navigating hazardous areas, particularly useful in basement sections.</p>
        <p><strong>Storm Stim:</strong> Specialized consumable designed to counter Storm Zone environmental hazards and combat mechanics.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Strategic Recommendations</h2>
        
        <h3>Preparation Checklist</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Best available weapons and armor</li>
            <li><strong>Consumables:</strong> Medical supplies, Yellow Stims, and Storm Stims</li>
            <li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> Sufficient rounds for extended combat</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Understanding of enemy patterns and area layouts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Risk Management</h3>
        <p><strong>Gradual Progression:</strong> Don't attempt Storm Zone entry until you've mastered all previous content and acquired optimal equipment.</p>
        <p><strong>Backup Plans:</strong> Always have extraction routes planned and emergency supplies ready.</p>
        <p><strong>Team Coordination:</strong> If playing with others, coordinate roles and responsibilities for maximum efficiency.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Storm Zone represents the pinnacle of challenge in Escape from Duckov. Success requires meticulous preparation, optimal equipment, and mastery of advanced combat techniques.

  <span >LEDX Acquisition Methods</span>
</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong >Random Loot Spawn Points:</strong>

        <p style="margin: 1em 0px;">
  In Escape from Duckov, J-Lab Access Cards are crucial for gaining access to the restricted laboratories scattered throughout the Duckov suburbs.
  While the first entry-level card (J-Lab 1) is relatively easy to find, more advanced versions—including Level 2 cards and colored access cards (red, blue, green, purple, yellow, and black)—are much rarer and typically unlocked through deeper exploration, looting, and completing specific quests.
</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">
  This guide details how to find each J-Lab card, its confirmed spawn areas, and the best search routes to make your lab raids efficient and repeatable.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>What are J-Lab Cards?</strong></h2>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">
  J-Lab Cards are security passes used to access underground research facilities located throughout the Duckov region.
  Different levels of cards grant access to deeper areas of the lab or color-coded containment zones associated with top-tier loot and lab equipment.
</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">Here's a brief description of each card type:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>J-Lab 1 Card</strong> – Basic-level access (access to standard lab areas)</li>
  <li><strong>J-Lab 2 Card</strong> – Intermediate-level access (access to areas B1 and below)</li>
  <li><strong>Colored Cards (Red, Blue, Green, Purple, Yellow, Black)</strong> – Advanced and optional keys used to unlock sealed wings or hidden lab areas</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;"><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike typical key items, these cards are <strong>consumable</strong>; one is consumed each time you enter the lab.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>J-Lab 1 Card – Basic Access</strong></h2>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>How to Obtain</strong></h3>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">
  In Escape from Duckov, there are two main ways to obtain your first J-Lab 1 Card:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Hidden Mine (Farm Town Area)</strong></li>
  <li>Search for card spawn points in the hidden mines near Farm Town. Cards may appear in corners, near mining equipment, or on walls. Cards respawn approximately every 4-5 game cycles, making them the best method of finding them in the early game.</li>
  <li><strong>Post-Quest Purchase: "Duplicate Pass"</strong></li>
  <li>Completing the "Duplicate Pass" side quest unlocks the merchant, Xiao Ming. After completing the mission, you can purchase J-Lab 1 Cards from Xiao Ming's shop for a fixed price. This is the most reliable way to restock.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Purpose</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>Open the entrance gate to J-Lab and begin your first official lab infiltration.</li>
  <li>Required for completing several early objectives related to the main storyline and loot milestones.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>J-Lab 2 Cards – Deeper Lab Access (Level B1)</strong></h2>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Where to Find It</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Lab B1 – Wanderer Drop</strong></li>
  <li>Level 2 Cards have a low chance of dropping from Wanderers on the B1 floor of the J-Lab complex after they are defeated. While the drop rate is low, consistently clearing the lab increases your chances of obtaining one.</li>
  <li><strong>Administrative Office Room Spawn</strong></li>
  <li>Some players have reported finding Level 2 Cards in the office on the first floor of the lab. Carefully inspect the room for desks, metal shelves, or computer terminals. These spawn points are not guaranteed to appear.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">
  <strong>Tips:</strong> Focus your search on areas patrolled by Wanderers, as they have the highest reported drop rate. Restarting a raid or switching servers may refresh the loot table, increasing your chances of finding a card.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Colored Access Cards</strong></h2>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">
  There are several ways to collect colored access cards for the Laboratory.
  One of the most effective methods is to search the <strong>Mysterious Key (X/O) room</strong>, where almost all cards and high-level supplies have a chance to spawn.
  However, the following cards have specific ways to obtain them:
</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Red Cards</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>A random drop after defeating the "?" boss in Farm Town.</li>
  <li>They may also spawn on the table in the northeast corner of the Blue Card room in the Laboratory.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Blue Cards</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>There is a chance of dropping them after defeating the Mine boss in Farm Town.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Green Cards</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>Spawn in two locations in the B2 Laboratory:</li>
  <li>On the west-facing chair in the small blue room across the hallway above the Yellow Card room.</li>
  <li>By the water fountain in the passage between the Jail and the Red Room.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Black Cards</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>The Mysterious Merchant in Farm Town may sell them for 200,000 credits.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Yellow Cards</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>May spawn in two locations in the Laboratory:</li>
  <li>On the table between the glass door of the Key Room and the facility entrance.</li>
  <li>On the table in the small room at the bottom left of the map (to the left of the extraction point).</li>
  <li><strong>PS:</strong> This card also drops from defeating the Mysterious Merchant in Farm Town. You can sneak attack him from behind the shipping container to his left.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Purple Cards</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>May spawn in the small house to the right of the Lumberyard in Farm Town.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">
  <img src="/images/guide/guide07-02.webp" alt="J-Lab Access Card (Purple)">
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Scouting and Development Strategy</strong></h2>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">For maximum efficiency, follow this route:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Start in Farm Town → Hidden Mine</strong></li>
  <li>While collecting loot and supplies, repeatedly search for J-Lab 1 cards, stocking up on at least 5-10.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete the "Duplicate Pass" quest.</strong></li>
  <li>Unlock Xiao Ming's shop to ensure a sustainable supply of J-Lab 1 cards.</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat J-Lab B1.</strong></li>
  <li>Focus on clearing enemies to obtain J-Lab 2 cards. Each complete clear increases your chances of receiving a rare drop.</li>
  <li><strong>Revisit Farm Town periodically.</strong></li>
  <li>Regularly check the Lumberyard, the Mysterious Merchant, and boss spawn points for purple, yellow, and other colored cards.</li>
  <li><strong>Save Premium Cards</strong></li>
  <li>Use colored cards only after you've identified your target room and are fully prepared. These cards are extremely valuable, so plan your exploration carefully.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">
  Collecting all the J-Lab cards in Escape from Duckov requires patience and consistent exploration.
  While the basic cards can be easily replenished, the vibrantly colored premium cards are reserved for players who truly delve into the game world—exploring every corner, raiding every bunker, and piecing together scattered clues.
  Good luck!
